CWWKD1000.repo.general.err=CWWKD1000E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface encountered an error. The error might indicate that the repository \
 method is not valid. The error is: {2}.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.explanation=An error was found with the specified \
 repository method.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine whether corrections are needed.

CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity=CWWKD1001E: The {0} repository method requires \
 an entity class but the {1} repository interface does not specify a primary \
 entity class. To correct this error, the {1} repository interface can extend \
 one of the built-in repository supertypes, such as {2}, and supply the entity \
 class as the first type parameter.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.explanation=Repository methods without an entity \
 class of their own require the repository to define a primary entity class.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.useraction=Define a primary entity class for the \
 repository.

CWWKD1002.method.annos.err=CWWKD1002E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is annotated with a combination of annotations that is not valid: {2}.
CWWKD1002.method.annos.err.explanation=This combination of annotations is not \
 valid on a single repository method.
CWWKD1002.method.annos.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine the correct combination of method annotations.

CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err=CWWKD1003E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 {3} method. Valid return types include: {4}.
CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for Insert, Update, and Save methods.
CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for the Insert, Update, and Save annotations for valid return types.

CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err=CWWKD1004E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 method.
CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for the type of repository method.
CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for a list of valid return types for the type of repository method.

CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err=CWWKD1005E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is not valid. The method specifies a {2} return type that is \
 not convertible from the {3} entity type. The result type of a \
 find operation must be the entity type, a type of an entity property, \
 a Java record composed of entity properties, or a type constructed \
 by the JPQL or JDQL that is supplied to the \
 Query annotation. The return type of the repository find method can be \
 the result type, an array of the result type, or any of the following types \
 parameterized with the result type: {4}.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for repository find methods.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for a list of valid return types for repository find methods.

CWWKD1006.delete.rtrn.err=CWWKD1006E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a delete \
 operation. The return type must be either void, long, int, boolean, array, \
 List, or Optional. A return type of void returns no value. A return type of \
 long or int returns a deletion count. A return type of boolean returns \
 an indicator of whether any entities were deleted. A return type of array, \
 List, or Optional, that is parameterized with either a {3} entity class or \
 a {4} unique identifier class returns the deleted entities or entity IDs.
CWWKD1006.delete.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for a delete operation.
CWWKD1006.delete.rtrn.err.useraction=Update the repository method to use one \
 of the supported return types.

CWWKD1007.updel.rtrn.err=CWWKD1007E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 {3} operation. The return type must be either void, long, int, or boolean. \
 A return type of void returns no value. A return type of long or int returns \
 a count of matching entities. A return type of boolean returns an indicator \
 of whether any entities match.
CWWKD1007.updel.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for an update or delete operation.
CWWKD1007.updel.rtrn.err.useraction=Update the repository method to use one \
 of the supported return types.

CWWKD1008.ambig.rtrn.err=CWWKD1008E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is ambiguous as a return type because it \
 corresponds to multiple entity properties: {3}. The repository method \
 must switch to the Query annotation and use a JDQL or JPQL query with a \
 SELECT clause that specifies which entity property to return.
CWWKD1008.ambig.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for a delete method.
CWWKD1008.ambig.rtrn.err.useraction=Update the repository method to use the \
 Query annotation to select the entity property.

CWWKD1009.lifecycle.param.err=CWWKD1009E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface cannot have {2} parameters because the method is annotated with the \
 {3} lifecycle annotation. Repository methods that are annotated with a lifecycle \
 annotation must have exactly 1 parameter, which must be the entity or an \
 array or List of the entity.
CWWKD1009.lifecycle.param.err.explanation=Lifecycle methods must have a single \
 entity parameter.
CWWKD1009.lifecycle.param.err.useraction=Update the repository method to have a \
 single parameter that is an entity or an array of List of the entity.

CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop=CWWKD1010E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface expects an entity property named {2} that is not found on the \
 {3} entity class. Valid property names for the entity are: {4}.
CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop.explanation=The repository method is attempting \
 to use an entity property that does not exist.
CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop.useraction=Update the repository method to match \
 a valid property that is defined by the entity.

CWWKD1011.unknown.method.pattern=CWWKD1011E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface does not match any of the Jakarta Data defined patterns. \
 A repository method must either use annotations, be a resource accessor method, \
 or be named according to the Query by Method Name pattern. Annotations such as \
 {2} are used to define operations. A resource accessor method must contain \
 no parameters and any of the {3} return types. The Query by Method Name pattern \
 must begin with one of the {4} keywords, followed by 0 or more characters. \
 Method names can also include the By keyword and one or more delimited \
 conditions. Examples of valid repository method names are: {5}.
CWWKD1011.unknown.method.pattern.explanation=Repository methods must follow the \
 Jakarta Data defined patterns.
CWWKD1011.unknown.method.pattern.useraction=Update the repository method to \
 adhere to one of the patterns from Jakarta Data.

CWWKD1012.fd.missing.param.anno=CWWKD1012E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface does not match an entity property. Parameters that \
 do not match an entity property must be annotated with the By annotation or have \
 one of the special parameter types: {3}. To define a condition for the \
 restriction of query results, the parameter must be annotated with the By \
 annotation and the value of the By annotation must be assigned to be the entity \
 property name. Alternatively, enable the -parameters compile option and give \
 the parameter the same name as the entity property.
CWWKD1012.fd.missing.param.anno.explanation=Parameters of repository find and \
 delete methods must correspond to entity properties or be special Jakarta Data \
 defined parameter types.
CWWKD1012.fd.missing.param.anno.useraction=Update the repository method such \
 that all parameters correspond to entity properties or have one of the Jakarta \
 Data special parameter types.

CWWKD1013.cde.missing.param.anno=CWWKD1013E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface does not match an entity property. Parameters \
 that do not match an entity property must be annotated with the By annotation and \
 the By annotation value must be assigned to be the entity property name. \
 Alternatively, enable the -parameters compile option and give the parameter \
 the same name as the entity property.
CWWKD1013.cde.missing.param.anno.explanation=Parameters of repository count, \
 delete, and exists methods must correspond to entity properties.
CWWKD1013.cde.missing.param.anno.useraction=Update the repository method such \
 that all parameters correspond to entity properties.

CWWKD1014.upd.missing.param.anno=CWWKD1014E: Parameter {0} of the {1} method of \
 the {2} repository interface does not match an entity property. Parameters that \
 do not match an entity property must have one of the parameter annotations: {3}. \
 To define a condition for the restriction of query results, the parameter must \
 be annotated with the By annotation and the By annotation value must be \
 assigned to be the entity property name. Alternatively, enable the \
 -parameters compile option and give the parameter the same name as the entity \
 property.
CWWKD1014.upd.missing.param.anno.explanation=Parameters of repository update \
 methods must correspond to entity properties.
CWWKD1014.upd.missing.param.anno.useraction=Update the repository method such that \
 all parameters correspond to entity properties.
