CWWKD1000.repo.general.err=CWWKD1000E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface encountered an error. The error might indicate that the repository \
 method is not valid. The error is: {2}.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.explanation=An error was found with the specified \
 repository method.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine whether corrections are needed.

CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity=CWWKD1001E: The {0} repository method requires \
 an entity class but the {1} repository interface does not specify a primary \
 entity class. To correct this error, the {1} repository interface must extend \
 one of the built-in repository supertypes, such as {2}, and supply the entity \
 class as the first type parameter.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.explanation=Repository methods without an entity \
 class of their own require the repository to define a primary entity class.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.useraction=Define a primary entity class for the \
 repository.

CWWKD1002.method.annos.err=CWWKD1002E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is annotated with a combination of annotations that is not valid: {2}.
CWWKD1002.method.annos.err.explanation=This combination of annotations is not \
 valid on a single repository method.
CWWKD1002.method.annos.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine the correct combination of method annotations.

CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err=CWWKD1003E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 {3} method. Valid return types include: {4}.
CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for Insert, Update, and Save methods.
CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for the Insert, Update, and Save methods for valid return types.

CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err=CWWKD1004E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 method.
CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for the type of repository method.
CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for a list of valid return types for the type of repository method.


CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err=CWWKD1005E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is not valid. The method specifies a {2} return type that is \
 not convertible from the {3} entity type. The result type of a \
 find operation must be the entity type, a type of an entity property, \
 a Java record composed of entity properties, or a type constructed \
 by the JPQL or JDQL that is supplied to the \
 Query annotation. The return type of the repository find method can be an \
 Optional or single value of the result type or it can be one of {4} or an \
 array of the result type.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for repository find methods.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data Javadoc \
 information for a list of valid return types for repository find methods.


CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop=CWWKD1010E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface expects an entity property named {2} that is not found on the \
 {3} entity class. Valid property names for the entity are: {4}.
CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop.explanation=The repository method is attempting \
 to use an entity property that does not exist.
CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop.useraction=Update the repository method to match \
 a valid property that is defined by the entity.
