CWWKD1000.repo.general.err=CWWKD1000E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface encountered an error indicating that the repository method might \
 not be valid. The error is: {2}.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.explanation=An error was found with the specified \
 repository method.
CWWKD1000.repo.general.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine whether corrections are needed.

CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity=CWWKD1001E: An entity class is needed by the {0} \
 repository method, but the {1} repository interface does not specify a primary \
 entity class. To correct this, have the {1} interface extend one of the \
 built-in repository supertypes, such as {2}, supplying the entity class as \
 the first type parameter.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.explanation=Repository methods without an entity \
 class of their own require a primary entity class to be defined by the \
 repository.
CWWKD1001.no.primary.entity.useraction=Define a primary entity class for the \
 repository.

CWWKD1002.method.annos.err=CWWKD1002E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface is annotated with a combination of annotations, {2}, that is not \
 valid.
CWWKD1002.method.annos.err.explanation=The combination of annotations is not \
 valid on a single repository method.
CWWKD1002.method.annos.err.useraction=Locate the repository interface and method \
 and determine the correct method annotations to use.

CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err=CWWKD1003E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 {3} method. Valid return types include: {4}.
CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for Insert, Update, and Save methods.
CWWKD1003.lifecycle.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the JavaDoc of the Insert, \
 Update, and Save methods for valid return types.

CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err=CWWKD1004E: The {0} return type of the {1} method \
 of the {2} repository interface is not a valid return type for a repository \
 method.
CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for the type of repository method.
CWWKD1004.general.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data JavaDoc for a \
 list of valid return types for the type of repository method.

CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err=CWWKD1005E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface specifies the {2} result type, which is not convertible from the \
 {3} entity type. The return type of a repository find method must be an \
 array, Collection, Optional, or single value of a result type that is the \
 entity type, an entity attribute type, or a Java record with component names \
 that are a subset of the entity property names, or the Query annotation must \
 be used to construct the result type with JPQL.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.explanation=The return type of the method is not \
 one of the supported return types for repository find methods.
CWWKD1005.find.rtrn.err.useraction=Refer to the Jakarta Data JavaDoc for a \
 list of valid return types for repository find methods.


CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop=CWWKD1010E: The {0} method of the {1} repository \
 interface expects an entity property named {2} that is not found on the \
 {3} entity class. Valid property names for the entity are: {4}.
CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop.explanation=The repository method is attempting \
 to use an entity property that does not exist.
CWWKD1010.unknown.entity.prop.useraction=Update the repository method to match \
 the properties that are defined by the entity.
