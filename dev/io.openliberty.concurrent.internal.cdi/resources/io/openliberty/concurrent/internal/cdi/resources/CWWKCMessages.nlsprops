CWWKC1410.schedule.lacks.seconds=CWWKC1410E: The Schedule, {0}, specifies an \
 empty value for the seconds at which to run. You must specify a non-empty value. \
 Alternatively, omit the seconds from the Schedule and rely on the default \
 behavior of scheduling the task to run at the second at the start of the minute.
CWWKC1410.schedule.lacks.seconds.explanation=The empty array value indicates that \
 the field must be disregarded when computing scheduled times. The seconds field \
 cannot accept an empty value because it is the most granular unit and cannot be \
 disregarded.
CWWKC1410.schedule.lacks.seconds.useraction=Modify the seconds field of the \
 Schedule annotation to specify a non-empty value, or omit the seconds field \
 from the Schedule.

 for the {1} annotation or {2} deployment descriptor element with the \
 {3} name and {4} qualifiers that is defined in the {5} application artifact. \
 The error is: {5}
CWWKC1411.qualified.res.err.explanation=An error occurred when creating the \
 resource or attempting to register it as a bean.
CWWKC1411.qualified.res.err.useraction=Ensure that the resource is configured \
 correctly.

CWWKC1412.qualifier.conflict=CWWKC1412E: The {0} application artifact includes \
 multiple {1} resource definitions that have the {2} qualifiers. The names of \
 the conflicting {1} resource definitions are: {3}.
CWWKC1412.qualifier.conflict.explanation=Qualifiers must uniquely identify a \
 resource type.
CWWKC1412.qualifier.conflict.useraction=Each resource definition of the same \
 type must have different qualifiers or must not have any qualifiers.
