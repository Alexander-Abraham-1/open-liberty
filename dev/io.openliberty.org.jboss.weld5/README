Summery: If you want to build this project but not modify it the changes to the build should be completely invisible to you.

-------------------

The build system for this project is unusual, but not complicated.

When you compile the code with the gradle task compileJava it will automatically execute a prerequisite task that:

1. Downloads and extracts weld-osgi-bundle from artifactory and extracts it to build/lib/unzip
2. Reads the MANIFEST.MF file to generate a list of imports and a list of exports
3. Applies modifications to those lists - the rules for modifications are found in build.gradle
4. Creates a new bnd file from template.bnd and those updated lists.
5. Checks if the new bnd file has any differences to check-me-in-if-i-change.bnd, and if so replaces check-me-in-if-i-change.bnd

-------------------

If you want to update weld to a new version all you have to do is update the variable "weldVersion" in build.gradle (and in dev/cnf as usual)

If you want to add a new import or export to the manifest modify the variable "additionalExports" or "additionalImports"

If you want to add a new property to an export (e.g. we add "thread-context=true" to the export "org.jboss.weld.event") add an entry to the map "additionalPropertiesForExports"

(There is no code for adding properties to imports, but it would be trivial to write some based on the code for adding properties to imports)
