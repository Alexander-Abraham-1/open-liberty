resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E=CWOWB1007E: The producer field, {0}, has type {1}, which does not match the type of the injected object.
resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E.explanation=CDI found a resource producer field where the type of the field did not match the type of the Java EE resource injected into it.
resource.producer.validation.error.CWOWB1007E.useraction=Ensure that the correct Java EE resource is being injected into the resource producer field and that the type of the field matches the type of the resource injected into it.

no.injection.target.CWOWB1008E=CWOWB1008E: The member {0} of class {1} cannot be injected as class {1} is not in a bean archive.
no.injection.target.CWOWB1008E.explanation=The injection is not successful as the bean manager of the archive that the class belongs to is null.
no.injection.target.CWOWB1008E.useraction=Ensure that the archive the class belongs to is a bean archive. Refer to the CDI specification on how to make an archive a bean archive.

implicit.bean.scanning.disabled.CWOWB1009W=CWOWB1009W: Implicit bean archives are disabled.
implicit.bean.scanning.disabled.CWOWB1009W.explanation=Archives are not scanned for CDI beans unless they have a beans.xml file.
implicit.bean.scanning.disabled.CWOWB1009W.useraction=Ensure that every archive that uses CDI has a beans.xml file or re-enable implicit beans scanning in your server.xml file.

spi.extension.failed.to.construct.CWOWB1010E=CWOWB1010E: Failed to create CDI Extension {0} with SPI because of the exception {1}.
spi.extension.failed.to.construct.CWOWB1010E.explanation=CDI failed to invoke the constructor of an extension class that is registered with the getExtensions() method of a CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
spi.extension.failed.to.construct.CWOWB1010E.useraction=Fix the error that is preventing your extension from instantiating.

spi.extension.class.in.different.bundle.CWOWB1011E=CWOWB1011E: A {0} class registered through the CDI Extension SPI is in a different bundle than the CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
spi.extension.class.in.different.bundle.CWOWB1011E.explanation=The class is ignored because it was registered with the getExtensions() or getBeanClasses() method of a CDIExtensionMetadata implementation and is in a different bundle than the CDIExtensionMetadata implementation.
spi.extension.class.in.different.bundle.CWOWB1011E.useraction=Move the affected class or create a new CDIExtensionMetadata implementation in the correct bundle.

exception.creating.extensions.CWOWB1012E=CWOWB1012E: CDI encountered an exception when it created extensions for the {0} archive. The error was: {1}
exception.creating.extensions.CWOWB1012E.explanation=CDI failed to load or invoke the construction of an extension class.
exception.creating.extensions.CWOWB1012E.useraction=Fix the error that is preventing the extension from being created.

bce.not.loadable.CWOWB1013E=CWOWB1013E: The {0} BuildCompatibleExtension class cannot not be loaded.
bce.not.loadable.CWOWB1013E.explanation=The application includes a META-INF/services/jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension file that includes the class, but CDI could not load the class.
bce.not.loadable.CWOWB1013E.useraction=Ensure the class is present in the application and can be loaded. If the class is present in the application, an FFDC file might have more information about why the class could not be loaded.

bce.does.not.implement.bce.CWOWB1014E=CWOWB1014E: The {0} class does not implement the BuildCompatibleExtension interface.
bce.does.not.implement.bce.CWOWB1014E.explanation=The application includes a META-INF/services/jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension file that includes the class, but the class does not implement jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension
bce.does.not.implement.bce.CWOWB1014E.useraction=Change the class so that it implements jakarta.enterprise.inject.build.compatible.spi.BuildCompatibleExtension.

cdi12.element.type.superceded.CWOWB1015W=CWOWB1015W: The configuration element type cdi12 has been superceded by the element type cdi.
cdi12.element.type.superceded.CWOWB1015W.explanation=The cdi configuration element type completely replaces the old cdi12 element. The cdi configuration element type contains all the same options as the old one, plus some new ones.
cdi12.element.type.superceded.CWOWB1015W.useraction=Change your server.xml configuration to use the cdi element type instead of the cdi12 element type.

cdiEmptyBeansXMLExplicitArchive.ignored.CWOWB1016W=CWOWB1016W: The attribute emptyBeansXMLExplicitArchive of element type cdi is only supported on CDI 4.0 and newer. The attribute will be ignored.
cdiEmptyBeansXMLExplicitArchive.ignored.CWOWB1016W.explanation=The attribute emptyBeansXMLExplicitArchive has no effect when using a CDI version lower than 4.0.
cdiEmptyBeansXMLExplicitArchive.ignored.CWOWB1016W.useraction=Update your server.xml configuration to either remove the attribute or use CDI version 4.0 or newer.

enableImplicitBeanArchives.conflict.CWOWB1017W=CWOWB1017W: The attribute enableImplicitBeanArchives was set on both cdi12 and cdi configuration elements. Using the value from the cdi element. Removing the cdi12 element is recommended.
enableImplicitBeanArchives.conflict.CWOWB1017W.explanation=Although enableImplicitBeanArchives can be set on both of the cdi12 and cdi configuration element types, they must not be set at the same time.
enableImplicitBeanArchives.conflict.CWOWB1017W.useraction=Update your server.xml to avoid the conflict. The recommended action is to remove the cdi12 element as it has been superceded by the cdi element.
