CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable=CWWKC1200E: {0}, which is defined by application {1}, did not become available in a timely manner.
CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable.explanation=There might be too much load on the system to process resource definition annotations and deployment descriptor entries before the application attempts to use them.
CWWKC1200.resource.unavailable.useraction=View the logs to identify if an error occurred. Otherwise, reduce the load on the system.

CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible=CWWKC1201E: {0}, which is defined by application {1}, requires a ContextService {2} but the ContextService is inaccessible or did not become available in a timely manner.
CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible.explanation=A resource definition annotation or a resource definition in a deployment descriptor of the application specifies an incorrect JNDI name at which to find a ContextService, or the ContextService is defined in a scope which is not accessible to the resource, or the system is under too much load to register the ContextService in a timely manner.
CWWKC1201.contextsvc.inaccessible.useraction=Correct the application to refer to the JNDI name of ContextService that is accessible. Reduce the load on the system if the JNDI name is already correct.
